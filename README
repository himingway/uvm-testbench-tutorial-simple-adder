How to run
----------

This Makefile is made to be used with Synopsys VCS but it should be easily adaptable to any SystemVerilog simulator.

To run the simulation you just need to type:

	$ make -f Makefile.vcs


Configuration
-------------

You'll need to edit the Makefile.vcs file and change the variable 'UVM_HOME' to your UVM installation.


Explanation of the code
